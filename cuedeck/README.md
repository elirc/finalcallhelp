# CueDeck

**Start here: [Complete Groq free-tier testing walkthrough](README_GROQ_TESTING.md)** —
account/key setup, every app action, recording tests, profiles, history exports, troubleshooting,
and manual/automated testing checklists.

CueDeck is a **free, local-first conversation practice and disclosed-assistance coach** for
Windows. Press **Listen**, let it hear a short clip of this computer's audio (a mock-interview
question, a permitted call), and it transcribes the clip and streams a concise first-person
response card grounded in _your_ profile. The prompt instructs the model not to invent
experience and fences your data; that is a prompting defence, not a guarantee, so review
each answer.

Built for: mock interviews and rehearsal, disclosed response cues on permitted calls,
accessibility support, and anyone who wants a call assistant without a subscription.

**Not built for:** covert recording, proctored assessments, or any setting where outside help
is prohibited. CueDeck always shows a recording indicator while capturing, has no
hidden-recording or screen-share-concealment features, and never will. You are responsible for
participant consent and the rules that apply to your calls. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## Zero mandatory spend

### Quickest way to test

From the parent folder, double-click **Start CueDeck.cmd**, or run:

```powershell
cd cuedeck
npm ci
npm start
```

After the acknowledgement, choose **Use cloud free tier**. Select **Groq**, open
**Get Groq API key**, and create a key in your own [Groq account](https://console.groq.com/keys).
Paste it into CueDeck and click **Save and test**. One key configures both Whisper transcription
and GPT-OSS responses. This tests an actual short response without sending your profile or audio.
Use an account on Groq's Free plan; the app cannot determine your provider billing plan.

Continue through the optional audio test and profile. On the Coach, type a question or choose
**Draw a question**, then **Respond to edited text**. This tests real AI without audio setup.
To test **Listen**, play spoken audio through your speakers/headphones; it captures computer
output, not your microphone. No Ollama installation or model downloads are needed with Groq.

For an immediate interface test, choose **Try the demo**. It streams a fixed sample response
with no key or downloads, and supports copy, cancel, and optional history. It does **not** use
AI or record audio. **Set up real AI** returns to setup whenever you are ready.

Alternatives: Gemini supports audio and responses with one key. OpenRouter's free router supports
typed questions immediately; recording additionally needs local Whisper. Cerebras currently offers
a free trial for responses. See [free testing options](docs/FREE_TESTING.md) for links and limits.

### Fully local option

Local mode is the default and the only mode labeled **Always free**:

- **Speech-to-text:** a Whisper-compatible ONNX model (~120–600 MB depending on size choice,
  downloaded once) running on device via
  [Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js) in an isolated Electron
  utility process (a helper process separate from both the UI and the main process).
- **Responses:** any local model served by [Ollama](https://ollama.com) at
  `http://127.0.0.1:11434` by default, or another validated loopback address/port
  (e.g. `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b-instruct`).
- No account, API key, credit card, telemetry, or hosted backend. After the one-time model
  downloads, the full flow works offline.

Optional **cloud free-tier** adapters (Groq, Cerebras, Google Gemini, OpenRouter `:free` models) are
available for older hardware. They are labeled _free tier; limits may change_, require your own
API key (stored encrypted with Windows DPAPI — the OS's built-in Data Protection API, which
encrypts data so only your Windows user account can decrypt it), show each provider's data-use
policy before use, and are never fallen back to silently. Model selection is restricted to the
supported catalog (and OpenRouter `:free` models), but cloud billing depends on your account plan.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement       | Version / notes                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows           | 10 or 11, x64. CueDeck targets Windows only (system loopback audio, DPAPI).                                                                                                                     |
| Node.js           | 22 LTS or newer (the project pins `@types/node` 22). Includes npm.                                                                                                                              |
| Ollama (optional) | Needed for local responses: install from <https://ollama.com/download>, then `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b-instruct` (or `llama3.2:3b`, `phi3.5:3.8b`). Skip it if you plan to use a cloud free tier. |
| Disk space        | ~120 MB (Whisper Tiny) to ~600 MB (Whisper Small) for the one-time local speech-to-text model download, plus whatever Ollama model you pull.                                                    |

No global CLI installs are required — Electron, Electron Forge, Vite, and all tooling are local
dev dependencies installed by `npm install`. You do not need Python, Visual Studio, or any
native build toolchain: the native pieces (the ONNX runtime used by Transformers.js) ship as
prebuilt binaries.

## First run (development)

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd cuedeck
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` runs Electron Forge, which starts Vite dev servers (with hot reload for the UI)
and launches the Electron app pointing at them. The first window is the onboarding flow:

1. **Consent acknowledgement** — you confirm you understand the visible-recording and
   participant-consent rules. Required before anything else works.
2. **Mode choice** — cloud free tier (quickest setup), a no-key interface demo, or fully local.
3. **Local setup** (local mode) — pick and download a Whisper ONNX model (Tiny ~120 MB /
   Base ~200 MB, recommended / Small ~600 MB) and let the app detect Ollama. Models download
   from Hugging Face into `%APPDATA%\CueDeck\models`. **Cloud setup** (cloud mode) — pick a
   provider, read its data-use disclosure, and paste your API key.
4. **Audio test** — play any audio on the computer, then run a 5-second capture test to verify
   system loopback audio works. Loopback audio means the app records what the computer is
   _playing_ (speakers/headphones output), not your microphone.
5. **Optional profile** — background text about you that responses are grounded in.

After onboarding you land on the Coach window: press **Listen**, let it capture a clip, and a
response card streams in. Settings live in a separate Preferences window.

## The coach window

Everything is tuned for one loop: someone asks a question, you get a speakable response fast.

- **Auto-respond on pause** (on by default, toggleable): while listening, the app watches the
  audio level and stops + submits by itself about 1.6 s after the speaker finishes — no
  reaction-time lag from clicking Stop. Turn it off to control the clip manually.
- **Low-latency pipeline**: the response model is pre-warmed the moment recording starts (the
  cold start happens while the other person is still talking), the LLM warms again during
  transcription, and answers stream token by token. The status rail shows the timing split
  (transcribe / first words / total) after each response.
- **Session notes**: a small free-text field (company, role, points to hit) sent with every
  request and used to ground the response, alongside your profile. Cleared per call, never
  stored.
- **Practice deck**: draw from ~30 built-in interview questions (by category) into the
  transcript box, answer aloud, then generate a suggested response to compare. Works fully
  offline — it reuses the same respond pipeline.
- **Speaking-pace estimate**: each finished answer shows its word count and estimated speaking
  time against your target (15/30/60 s), so you know whether the draft fits before you use it.
- **Eye-line placement**: the coach window opens top-centre of the screen, right under a
  laptop or monitor webcam, with the response card first, so reading the answer keeps your
  gaze near the camera. **Eye line** in the title bar (or Preferences → General) re-docks it
  there and pins it above the call; **Compact** hides everything but the controls and the
  response in larger text. The window remembers where you last put it.
- **Call-type profiles**: each profile carries a call type (technical interview, behavioral
  interview, sales or discovery call, customer support, team meeting, general) and an
  optional tech stack. The call type adds fixed answering rules to the prompt; the tech
  stack is sent as fenced reference data. Switch profiles from the title-bar picker.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: `Ctrl+L` listen / stop &amp; respond, `Esc` cancel, `Ctrl+Shift+C`
  copy the response.
- **History search** (Preferences → History, only if history is enabled): filter saved
  sessions by any words in the transcript or response.

App data (settings, encrypted keys, profiles, optional history, downloaded models) lives under
`%APPDATA%\CueDeck\`. Deleting that folder resets the app, including onboarding. See
[PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for the full file-by-file list.

| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev` / `npm start` | Same command (`electron-forge start`): dev app with Vite hot reload.                                                                                                                              |
| `npm run build`             | Production bundles — main, preload, STT worker (into `.vite/build/`) and renderer (into `.vite/renderer/`). Used by the E2E suite; you rarely run it alone.                                       |
| `npm run typecheck`         | Strict TypeScript over the whole project, no output files (`tsc --noEmit`).                                                                                                                       |
| `npm run lint`              | ESLint over `src`, `test`, and the root `*.ts` configs.                                                                                                                                           |
| `npm run format`            | Prettier, write mode (rewrites files).                                                                                                                                                            |
| `npm run format:check`      | Prettier, check-only (fails if formatting is off; used in `check`).                                                                                                                               |
| `npm test`                  | Unit tests (`test/unit`) with Vitest, single run.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `npm run test:watch`        | Same unit tests in watch mode.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `npm run test:integration`  | Provider/IPC integration tests (`test/integration`) against local fake HTTP servers — no real network or API keys needed.                                                                         |
| `npm run test:e2e`          | Runs `npm run build`, then Playwright launches the real packaged-style Electron app (`test/e2e`). Serial by design (one worker); each run gets an isolated user-data dir via `CUEDECK_USER_DATA`. |
| `npm run package`           | Electron Forge package step: the app folder without an installer.                                                                                                                                 |

Electron vocabulary, in one pass: an Electron app has a **main process** (Node.js, full OS
access) and one or more **renderer processes** (Chromium pages that show the UI). They talk
over **IPC** (inter-process communication — structured messages, here validated with Zod on
every call). The renderer runs with **contextIsolation** (the page's JavaScript world is
separated from Electron internals, so web code can't reach Node APIs) and is exposed exactly
one bridge: the **preload** script, which runs before the page loads and publishes a fixed,
typed API via `contextBridge`. CueDeck's renderer is additionally sandboxed with Node
integration off, and the packaged binary flips Electron **fuses** (build-time switches that
permanently disable escape hatches like `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`).

## Architecture

```text
Sandboxed React renderer  (contextIsolation, no Node, fixed preload API)
  │  Zod-validated IPC, sender-checked, sessionId + sequence on every event
  ▼
Electron main process
  ├─ window/session hardening (CSP from default-src 'none', nav denial, fuses)
  ├─ one-use expiring capture grant → Windows loopback audio (16 kHz AudioContext + worklet)
  ├─ session coordinator (abort, stage timeouts, structured errors)
  ├─ public settings (JSON + migrations) / secret vault (safeStorage ciphertext)
  ├─ provider registry
  │    ├─ local Whisper STT → utility process (Transformers.js; single-flight loads,
  │    │    downloads only on explicit request, idle unload after 15 min)
  │    ├─ Ollama localhost NDJSON streaming
  │    └─ optional HTTPS: Groq / Cerebras / Gemini / OpenRouter (host allowlist)
  └─ optional local history + diagnostics (secret-redacted)
```

Notes on the diagram: the **capture grant** means the renderer must explicitly arm a one-use,
8-second-TTL permission before Windows loopback audio can be captured — any other
`getDisplayMedia` request is denied. **NDJSON** (newline-delimited JSON) is Ollama's streaming
format: one JSON object per line, which the app parses incrementally to stream tokens into the
response card. The main process may only contact loopback plus a short hardcoded host allowlist
(Groq, Cerebras, Google, OpenRouter, Hugging Face — see `src/shared/constants.ts`), and refuses
redirects. Local model files are fetched separately by Transformers.js in the STT utility
process, and only when you press **Download**; warmups and transcriptions never download.
Besides session events, the main process pushes `settings:changed` and `readiness:changed`
(credential saved/removed, model installed/removed) so every window re-checks readiness without
a restart. Packaged builds ship without the default Electron menu, and the renderer gets the
`media` permission only while a capture grant is armed. Unreadable store files are quarantined
(`<name>.corrupt-<time>.json`) rather than overwritten. Test tiers and coverage: see
[docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md).

## Troubleshooting

**`npm run dev` fails to launch or the window is blank.**
Check the terminal first — Forge prints Vite build errors there. If a previous dev instance is
still running, close it: the app takes a single-instance lock, so a second launch quits
immediately and just focuses the first window. If a port collision is reported (another Vite
dev server running elsewhere, `EADDRINUSE`), stop the other dev server and retry.

**Errors mentioning `onnxruntime` or native modules.**
`@huggingface/transformers` is deliberately kept out of the app bundles and loaded from
`node_modules` at runtime (its ONNX runtime contains native binaries; packaged builds unpack
them from the asar archive automatically). If it fails to load in dev, delete `node_modules`
and `package-lock.json`-driven state and reinstall (`Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules;
npm install`), and make sure you are on x64 Node 22+. No manual `electron-rebuild` step exists
or is needed in this project.

**The Whisper model download is slow or fails.**
Models are 120–600 MB and come from Hugging Face (`huggingface.co` and its CDN hosts are on
the allowlist). Downloaded files are cached in `%APPDATA%\CueDeck\models`; if a download went
wrong, use **Remove downloaded model** (two-step confirm) and then "Download / verify selected
model" in Preferences → Providers to fetch it again. Behind a proxy or firewall, those hosts must be reachable —
there is no mirror setting.

**"Ollama not detected" or responses never start.**
Ollama must be running and reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:11434` (changeable in Preferences).
Check with `ollama list` in a terminal. If Ollama runs but has no models, pull one:
`ollama pull qwen2.5:3b-instruct`. The app never silently falls back to a cloud provider.

**The audio test says "silent".**
Loopback capture records what the computer plays, not your microphone — so play music or a
video _during_ the 5-second test. Very low system volume can also fall under the silence
threshold. Capture requests are denied unless armed by the app itself, so run the test from the
onboarding/UI button, and note the recording indicator is always visible while capturing.

**E2E tests are slow or flaky when run in parallel.**
They are intentionally serial (`workers: 1` in `playwright.config.ts`) because an Electron app
owns one user-data directory per launch. `npm run test:e2e` always rebuilds first; each run
isolates its data via the `CUEDECK_USER_DATA` env var (see `.env.example`).

**Windows SmartScreen warns when installing a build.**
Expected: `npm run make` produces an unsigned installer. Verify downloads against the published
SHA-256 checksums instead (see below).

**Where is my data? How do I reset?**
Everything is under `%APPDATA%\CueDeck\`. Deleting the folder wipes settings, encrypted keys,
profiles, history, and models, and re-triggers onboarding. Diagnostics output is
secret-redacted before display.

## Packaging & releases

`npm run make` produces an **unsigned** installer (`out/make/squirrel.windows/x64/CueDeck-Setup.exe`)
plus a zip. Windows SmartScreen will warn on unsigned installers; publish SHA-256 checksums
alongside artifacts (`scripts/checksums.mjs` writes `out/make/SHASUMS256.txt`) so users can
verify downloads. Code signing requires funding and is on the post-MVP list.

## Contributor documentation

New to the codebase? Read these in order — they assume only basic Node/React knowledge and
explain the Electron-specific pieces as they go:

1. [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — the process model and a step-by-step trace of
   one "Listen" session, from button press through capture, transcription, and the streamed
   response card.
2. [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) — how to make common changes safely: adding an LLM
   provider, adding an IPC channel, adding a renderer route, and where validation lives.
3. [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) — what each test tier covers and how to decide where a new
   test belongs.

## Security & privacy

- [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — threat model and controls: sandboxed renderer, context
  isolation, no Node integration, IPC sender + payload validation, one-use capture grant,
  outbound host allowlist, `safeStorage`-encrypted credentials (DPAPI on Windows), and no
  `setContentProtection` or any capture-concealment API, ever.
- [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) — exactly what is stored, where, and what leaves the machine in
  each mode (in local mode: nothing except model downloads you start and requests to your
  local Ollama).
